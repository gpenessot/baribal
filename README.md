# baribal üêª

A Python package extending pandas with helper functions for simpler exploratory data analysis and data wrangling.

## Why Baribal?

While pandas is incredibly powerful, some R functions like `glimpse()`, `tabyl()`, or `clean_names()` make data exploration and manipulation particularly smooth. Baribal brings these functionalities to Python, helping you to:

- Get quick, insightful overviews of your DataFrames
- Perform common data cleaning tasks with less code
- Handle missing values more intuitively
- Generate summary statistics with minimal effort

## Features

- üîç `glimpse()`: R-style enhanced DataFrame preview
- üßπ Smart column naming and cleaning utilities
- üìä Enhanced statistical summaries
- üîÆ Better missing values handling
- More coming soon...

## Installation

```bash
pip install baribal
```

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
import baribal as bb

# Get an intuitive overview of your DataFrame
bb.glimpse(df)

# More examples coming soon...
```

```
